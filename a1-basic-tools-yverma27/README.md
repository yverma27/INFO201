3. Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) user account.
3. Configure git on your computer.
4. Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (optional for this assignment but you should do it now).

## Part I: The Command Line [10 points]
In Part I, you will practice working with the command line.

**Step #1**: In your directory, you will find a file named ``git-commands.md``. Open the file with Atom, which is our text editor.

**Step #2**: Following each prompt in the file ``git-commands.md``, write the line of code that you used to accomplish the task or otherwise answer the question.

**Step #3**: Save the changes to you've made to ``git-commands.md`` and then add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub.


## Part II: Working with Markdown [35 points]

In Part II, you will create a report in Markdown about a data visualization featured in *Data Feminism*. First, browse through all the chapters, and pick a data visualization that stands out to you or seems interesting to you from the textbook. Note: we do not mean a photo or an image but a data visualization — that is, a graphical representation of data, like a line chart, graph, or map. Your task is to create a report about this visualization that summarizes it and explains its significance and background.


1. Create a Markdown file that will contain your report called ``report.md`` in the root directory of the repository. [2 points]
1. Come up with a title for your report, and make the title a top-level Markdown header. [2 points]
1. Include "By [Your Name]" on the line beneath the title, and make your name a level-2 header. [2 points]
1. Include the date of your report on the next line, and make the date italicized. [2 points]

1. Create a level-2 header titled "Data Viz Summary." [2 points]
1. Include an image of the data visualization by downloading the image and including it as a file in this repository (you will probably want to rename the file). Your image should display properly on GitHub, so if it's not showing up, you haven't used the correct file path. [5 points]
1. Beneath the image, provide a 100-word summary of the visualization — what specifically does the data viz show or communicate? [3 points]
1. Include a quotation from *Data Feminism* (or another source) about the data visualization or its significance somewhere in the summary. Format this quotation as a block quote. (This quotation does not count for your 100-word summary). [3 points]
1. Create a level-2 header titled "Data Viz Biography." [2 points]
1. In this section, you will answer the following questions. Bold these questions, make them an ordered list, and then write answers (not bolded) beneath the questions:

  - Who or what institution produced the visualization? (Hint: refer to ["Figure Credits"](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ftb0980j/release/1?readingCollection=0cd867ef))
  - When was it produced?
  - Who is the audience for the visualization?
  - How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?
  - How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?
  [10 points]
1. Lastly, add at least one hyperlink and one emoji somewhere in the report. You can add them anywhere! [2 points]
