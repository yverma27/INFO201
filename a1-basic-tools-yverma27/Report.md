Summary: This data visualization tries to show the number of daily kidnappings in Nigeria between 1982 and 2014. 
In April 2014, 276 young women were kidnapped in Nigeria from their high school. 
A militant terrorist group, named Boko Haram, had taken accountability for these attacks. 
There were many media outlets that had posted reports about these incidents. 
One specific blog, FiveThirtyEight, had published its own story backed by data about this incident. 
It was talking about how the number of kidnapping cases had skyrocketed recently. 
It mentioned how there were more than 3,608 kidnapping cases of young women in 2013 alone. 
This blog got its data from Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). 
However, since GDELT’s main source of data was through media sources, this graph doesn’t provide an accurate number of kidnappings that occurred but instead counts each of the reports about the April 2014 kidnapping incident as separate kidnapping cases. 
This provided an inaccurate number of actual kidnapping cases in Nigeria. Here is the link to learn more about this data visualization: [Daily Kidnappings in Nigeria](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/3#nxbh53hmpa0).

> The kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria was a single event. 
> There were thousands of global media stories about it. 
> Although GDELT de-duplicated some of those stories to a single event, it still logged, erroneously, that hundreds of kidnapping events had happened that day. 
> The FiveThirtyEight report had counted each of those GDELT pseudoevents as a separate kidnapping incident.




## Data Viz Biography

1. **Who or what institution produced the visualization?**
   
     This visualization was produced by Mona Chalabi, the author of the article "Kidnapping of Girls in Nigeria Is Part of a Worsening Problem", which was posted on a blog called FiveThirtyEight.

3. **When was it produced?**
   
     This visualization was produced in 2014.

5. **Who is the audience for the visualization?**
   
     This visualization is meant for anyone who wants to read about kidnapping cases in Nigeria and readers of the FiveThirtyEight blog.

7. **How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**
   
     This visualization can be misinterpreted because the data is not completely accurate. This source failed to recognize that the data source they used to create this visualization was not counting the number of kidnapping events that occurred, but the number of media 
     reports about the kidnapping events. Through this data visualization source, it is hard to tell how many kidnapping incidents actually occurred in Nigeria.

9. **How, if at all, does the visualization represent power or systems?**
    
     This visualization is a great representation of Big Dick Data, which is a term that the authors of Data Feminism have created to describe how such projects completely disregard context, and only focus on size. This is one such example that proves how context plays such a big role 
     when talking about data. Without context, we are unable to understand the functional limitations of the data and how the power/privilege used to make the data may hide the complete truth.
